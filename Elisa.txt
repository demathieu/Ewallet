basic:

-> StateFull (How to model this)
-> Allow/Deny
-> Install

what kind of target?
-> Property/Function
	->Read/Write/Execute
-> Arguments





Additional hooks: Can be gathered as condition

-> After/Before
-> WhiteList
-> sensitiveResourcesList
-> Regex Check


Things I wasn't able to do:

1) Logging
2) A policy where you check all the already existing links in a html file, if they are in a whitelist
3)How to combine two policies? Example :
AliceSafe = new policyBuilder.policy(whitelist).allow('amount').read().install(alice);  

AliceSafe = new policyBuilder.policy(whitelist).allow('deposit').install(alice);


Problems?

How to model this with traits


what happends when we have a function like this

function a(){
	b();
	c();
	deny(); // this function is not allowed
}
	b and c will still be triggered, meaning it can change the state of my program
